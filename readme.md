# [Project: Positioning and Floating Elements](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/html-and-css/lessons/positioning-and-floating-elements)


## Introduction

In this project, my assignment is to copy [this](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/18/science/space/detection-of-waves-in-space-buttresses-landmark-theory-of-big-bang.html?_r=0) article from the New York Times.

You can use any or all of the positioning techniques you’ve learned in this section. The modern way would be to use Flexbox or Grid. There are certain times where Flexbox and Grid can’t achieve the layout you want, knowing floats and other positioning techniques is valuable practice and you should try and use a combination of techniques for this project.

## Assignment
Note: As usual, ignore any ads, comments or interactive elements (which use JavaScript) and don’t worry about what happens when you change the page width (they use some media queries to rearrange things). Focus on making it look similar.
